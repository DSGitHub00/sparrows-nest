**ABOUT**

We could open this
introduction with a statement about the meaning of our name: about
how the fleeting, virtual essence of the “Data Sparrow” is an
allegory for a collective with no physical headquarters, no “roots”
but rather “wings”, spanning across this strange world in the
form of our members – as it’s only thanks them that the Sparrow
can take flight and reach new heights.

But that’d be one
flight of fancy too many for what amounts to a group of all-too-eager
hobbyists, so let’s keep our feet on the ground for now.

Basically, Data
Sparrow is an art collective. For what kind of art? Whichever we have
the facilities and ideas to pursue, mostly. Currently, we’re
focusing on tabletop games and printed media. In the future? Who
knows! Nothing is off the table aside from a few, obviously unethical
endeavors that have been catching on these past couple of years, so
if we ever have the means to actually put out a videogame or two,
we’ll most certainly try.

Our aesthetic
preferences and areas of expertise are as many as our members, but
our founding value is the point around which it all pivots: branch
out whenever you can, don’t let ideas overstay their welcome, keep
it varied and fun.

To this end, our
projects currently take place in a single, expansive universe
designed from the ground up as a creative playground with minimal
guidelines. This streamlines setting-level writing immensely, as all
projects get to be on the same historical timeline and all that’s
needed is defining the details of the particular locations in which
each project takes place.

This, however,
doesn’t mean there’s some sort of grand converging narrative
going on: every Data Sparrow endeavor is a standalone work, whose
only references to other works amount to the natural amounts of
cross-pollination resulting from two planets being neighbors, or two
sports occupying the same niche. You can come in wherever, you can
come out wherever.

If any of this stuff
sounds up your alley, you’re welcome to take a look at our projects
and contact us if you want to know more about anything we’re
currently working on! We don’t like to show things publicly unless
we know they fundamentally work and are 100% going to be released,
but a question or two never hurt anyone.

**GAMES**

**FIST WORLD VOLGA**

**Release Date:
April 30th 2021**

**Platform: Itch.io**

**The year is 2391.**

Mankind has long
expanded into the great starry void. War after war, its path across
outer space was paved by the flesh and bone of the millions who have
fallen. Even in times of peace, the echoes of battles to come ring in
the ears of those who managed to survive, a grim reminder that all
that lives is shackled to the unbreakable chains of history....

**...but hey, at
least we've got giant robot arenas now.**

Scattered across
known space under the ownership of Galactica Sports Entertainment,
"Fist World" combat circuits are a staple of recreational
mech combat, taking up to 15% of the whole battleframe industry and
turning the worlds hosting their competitions into bustling hubs of
tourism, industry and under-the-counter gambling when the venue's
rent-a-cops aren't looking.

**So, all things
considered, not an entirely terrible deal.**

Especially for the
populace of a remote planet that, after some two hundred years of
isolation, resource scarcity and desperate struggle for survival,
eventually saw its homeworld become the main theater of an
interstellar conflict. After all, the cities are already in shambles
and the planet’s only moon has been sliced in two - letting some
offworlders set up shop and build a couple of stadiums could hardly
make things any worse.

***Welcome to
Fist World Volga!***

**TREMERINE: SEA OF THE STARS**

**Year of Release:
November 13th 2021**

**Platform: Itch.io**

**The year is 2394**

Nine years after the
tide of violence wrought by the Great Colonial War has upset a
century-old balance of power, humanity is once again entering an era
of fragile peace.

From the ashes of
the old Avignon Empire, firestarter of the conflict, a federation of
former vassal worlds has risen - denying the tantalizing offer of
growth and prosperity under the ever-increasing reach of the United
Systems Alliance in favor of long-awaited independence.

**Welcome to the
Tremerine Union.**

You and your
companions find yourselves in the midst of all this, sailing the sea
of the stars on the same starship for one reason or another: on a
mission, in search of profits, or simply looking for a good time.
Each of you may come from a different background or work a different
profession, but you will need to cooperate to get the job done.

***Who will you
be in this galaxy of opportunities?***

**SHARDANA: HYDRO
TRAIL GP**

**Year of Release:
Hopefully 2023**

**Platform: Itch.io**

**The year is 2395.**

A decade after the
war that shook the Outer Colonies and brought the Avignon Empire to
its knees, the Confederation of Shardana, an idyllic ocean world in
the Aurelia System, has finally returned to relative normalcy. As the
hulks of orbital warships float along coastlines lined with rubble,
it’s clear that the worst has come to pass - and now, the only way
to go is foward.

**Forward into an
uncertain, if ever so hopeful, future.**

Organized by the
Deadalus Consortium, Hydro Trail GP is an all-new naval racing
championship designed to bring new eyes to the otherwise niche
Shardanian national sport - a way to show, through glamourous events
and cutting edge technology, that Shardana is prepared for the
future.

**Six heats, five
teams, one champion.**

As engines and
rivalries alike flare up, the eyes of the Outer Colonies turn from
Volga’s biomecha brawling to the sparkling blue waters of the Pearl
of Aurelia. The starting grid is waiting, can you take the heat?

***Fasten your
seatbelts and link up your drinking cable for Hydro Trail GP!***

**SIRIUS:
TREACHEROUS REACHES**

**Year of Release:
[TBA]**

**Platform: Itch.io**

**The year is 2397.**

Lightyears away from
the blossoming Cosmic East, the sea of stars has become playing field
to an orbital shadow war. The prize? The allegiance of the
Sovereignty of Sirius - and the riches it can to offer to its new
masters.

**A shining gem of
the void, torn apart from the inside.**

The inhabitants of
the Sirius System, from the highest-standing Kshatriya Admiral to the
most destitute Shudra miner, have found themselves tangled into a
silent civil war seeded by neighboring superpowers. All it takes is
one “Blackout Mine”: paranoia and Caste-based grudges will do the
rest.

**In the shadow of
the stars, no one can hear you scheme.**

Life support systems
are down to the bare minimum, maneuvering thrusters are dead and long
range communications are fried: all you can do is listen to the pleas
of the unfortunate souls stuck in this mess with you, trying to track
their vessel through the radio waves and hoping they’re not using
this time to get a bead on your position.

**Fill up your air
tanks and pray you can survive Sirius: Treacherous Reaches.**
